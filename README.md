# Resources
* [Media Queries for Standard Devices](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/media-queries-for-standard-devices/)
* ^ Used the code on this site to set up the media queries for iPhone 6 and iPad 3 & 4 for responsiveness on all pages. 
* [JavaScript code for mouse ](http://www.javascriptkit.com/script/script2/sparkler.shtml)
* ^ Coding I used in a past project in a past class to create the mouse effect. When you move the mouse around the image of Remy follows you around.
* [Custom JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/removeEventListener)
* ^ Used this site to remove repetitiveness of h2 loading on menu page over and over again when h1 was clicked. I learned how to remove an event listener.
* [Custom jQuery for Interactivity](https://bavotasan.com/2009/a-simple-mouseover-hover-effect-with-jquery/)
* ^ With the help of the code on this website I was able to create the hover effect on the social media icons in the footer of the home page. This took me forever to figure out how to do even with the code. I tried many different things until I figured to separate the js code for each page into different js files.
* [1st jQuery Plugin](https://markgoodyear.com/2013/01/scrollup-jquery-plugin/)
* ^Used the scrollUp jQuery plugin as my first plugin requirement to remove the arrow I previously had on the events page to go back up to the top of the page. I copied the code exactly from this site and just changed the color and opacity of the scrollUp banner. This can be seen towards the bottom of the menu page as well. 
* [2nd jQuery Plugin](http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle2/download/)
* ^Completed my second and last jQuery plugin requirement with this slideshow "Cycle 2" effect on the images you see on the left side of the location page. The original demo had 3 images, I added more than 3. The images take a couple of seconds to load.
