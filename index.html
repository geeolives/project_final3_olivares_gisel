			<p>When Auguste Gusteau founded this restaraunt, it was the first to merit a 5-star rating, along with a cookbook named "Anyone Can Cook" which climbed to the top of the best-selling book list. But this was not to last forever. After feared food critic Anton Ego wrote a scathing review regarding Gusteau's cooking, the restaurant lost one star rating. Then the brokenhearted chef Gusteau died afterwards, resulting in the removal of another rating according to tradition. Gusteau's sous chef, Skinner, then inherited the restaurant and started a frozen food line using Gusteau's image, but he himself was not nearly as innovative as Gusteau. Thus, the restaurant sank into obscurity.</p>
